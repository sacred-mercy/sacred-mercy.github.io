Hello! I'm Gaurav. I love to explore system design and computer science. The idea behind these blogs is to explain concepts which I learnt and found interesting. Sometimes there could be tutorial but they would be there because I didn't found any reference work when I did that.
Happy to connect on email, twitter & Github.
